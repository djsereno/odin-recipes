        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This Thai basil fried rice is a staple of Thai cooking and a great
            use for leftover rice. Adjust the spices to your tastes. I get Thai
            basil from a local Asian market. It has a different flavor than
            regular basil and makes all the difference in this recipe. It is
            fast and fairly easy to make but requires constant stirring.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup peanut oil for frying</li>
            <li>6 large cloves garlic clove, crushed</li>
            <li>2 serrano peppers, crushed</li>
            <li>
                1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into thin strips
            </li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>4 cups cooked jasmine rice, chilled</li>
            <li>2 cups sweet Thai basil</li>
            <li>1 cucumber, sliced (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cilantro sprigs (optional)/li></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Whisk together oyster sauce, fish sauce, and sugar in a small
                bowl; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a wok over medium-high heat until oil begins to
                smoke. Add garlic and serrano peppers, stirring quickly. Stir in
                chicken, bell pepper, onion, and oyster sauce mixture; cook
                until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run
                clear.
            </li>
            <li>
                Increase heat to high and stir in chilled rice; stir quickly
                until sauce is well blended with rice. Use the back of a spoon
                to break up any rice sticking together.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the wok from heat. Stir in basil leaves. Garnish with
                sliced cucumber and cilantro.
            </li>
        </ol>
